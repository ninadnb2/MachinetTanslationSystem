# Machine Translation System

•	The main purpose of current work is to investigate English to Hindi translation using two different systems-Neural Machine Translation System and Google Translator.

•	Google translator supports 90 languages. Google translator limits the no of paragraphs and technical terms that can be translated.

•	By increasing the size of the dataset, the probability of a certain pair of phrases can be enhanced. However, the inability to achieve context information, different trained components, system complexity are the weak points of SMT, which led to the development of the NMT system

•	Machine Translation (MT) is the process of converting a source language into target language without any human entanglement such that the meaning of the source language is preserved in the translated text.

•	With a large amount of research available in the present-day, several types of NMT are already being looked into and being established in the industry. The Encoder-Decoder model is the most popular kind of the NMT model. The NMT model aims to take an individual sentence as an input and convert this sentence to a different language which is the final output.
